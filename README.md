### what is kubernetes

Kubernetes is a powerful open-source tool that helps organize computer tasks and services. It makes things easier by using clear instructions and automation, and it has a big community. The name "Kubernetes" comes from Greek, meaning captain or pilot. People often call it "K8s" because there are eight letters between "K" and "s." Google shared Kubernetes with everyone in 2014, combining their 15 years of experience with community ideas

### What other Orchestration tools are available other than Kubernetes

Several orchestration solutions, such as Docker Swarm, OpenShift, and Mesos, are available. Additionally, major cloud providers have their versions of Kubernetes. For instance, Amazon provides Amazon ECS, Google offers Google Container Engine (GKE), and Microsoft Azure provides Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).
